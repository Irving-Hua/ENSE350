# Lab 4
LU Decomposition

### About
```
1. Using LU decomposition method to factorize a given square matrix and returns the triangular matrices [L] and [U]
```

### Requirements
- Features:
```
Test function by using it to solve the following system of linear equations:

3(x1) - 2(x2) + (x3) = -10
2(x1) + 6(x2) - (x4) = 44
-8(x1) - 2(x2) + 5(x3) = -26
```
- Outputs:
```
Print out [L] triangular matrix and [U] triangular matrix
Checking [L] * [U] = [A]
```
