# Lab 4
Multiple Segment Trapezoidal

### About
```
Write a program that will numerically integrate this function from -10 to 10 using multiple segment trapezoidal rule.
```

### Requirements
- Features:
```
Test function by using it to solve the following system of integral:

f(x) = 2 - 5x + 10 * x^2 + 1/2 * x^3
```
- Inputs:
```
The number of segments should be an input to the program. Determine the true percent relative error and plot it as a function of the number of segments n.
```
