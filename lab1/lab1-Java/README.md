Euclidean Algorithm, Extended Euclideam Algorithm/Pulverizer, Fraction programming

### About
```
1. The Euclidean algorithm. A recursive method that computes the of two numbers and using the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,rem(a,b)).
```
```
2. The Pulverizer or the Extended Euclidean algorithm. This method should ask the user for two integers(a and b)and compute the values of s, t and gcd(a,b) in the following equation: gcd(a,b)=sa + tb.
```
```
3. An algorithm that accepts the numerator and denominator of a fraction as input and produces as output the numerator and denominator of that fraction written in lowest terms.
