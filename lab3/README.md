# Lab 2
The RSA Cryptosystem programming

### About
```
1. Using Newton-Raphson method to solve(less than 0.01% error): 
```

```
2. Using (a) the Bisection method and (b) the Secant method to solve(less than 0.01% error): 
f(x) = 230x4 + 18x3 + 9x2 - 221x -9
```

### Requirements

```
Compute gcd(a,b)
Find values of two integers s and t using Pulverizer or the Extended Euclidean algorithm method
Compute the public and private keys
Perform encryption and decryption
```
- Inputs:
```
For 1: initial value for x.
For 2: Bie
